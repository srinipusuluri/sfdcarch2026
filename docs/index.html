    <h1>Salesforce Architecture and Security Questions & Answers</h1>

    <details>
        <summary>1. How do you design a secure access control model in Salesforce? [Security]</summary>
        <div>
            <p>Designing a secure access control model in Salesforce involves a layered approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Profiles and Permission Sets: These determine object-level access (CRUD), field-level security, and system permissions. Profiles are the baseline, and permission sets extend access without changing the profile.</li>
                <li>Role Hierarchy: Defines access to records based on the role structure. Users higher in the hierarchy have access to records owned by users below them.</li>
                <li>Sharing Rules: Enable record-level sharing for specific users or groups outside the role hierarchy, allowing exceptions to the rule-based model.</li>
                <li>Manual Sharing: Allows record owners or users with the "Full Access" permission to share specific records.</li>
                <li>Field-Level Security: Limits access to individual fields based on the profile, ensuring sensitive data is visible only to the right users.</li>
                <li>Org-wide Defaults (OWD): Sets baseline access (public, private, or read-only) to records across the entire organization.</li>
                <li>IP Restrictions and Login Hours: Control access by restricting login locations and times, adding an additional layer of security.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </details>

                <li>Bulk API: Use the Bulk API for high-volume data transfers, as it is optimized for handling large datasets efficiently with fewer API calls.</li>
                <li>Composite API: Use the Composite API to bundle multiple API requests into a single call. This reduces the number of round trips to Salesforce, minimizing the total API usage and improving efficiency.</li>
                <li>Query Optimization: Optimize SOQL queries to retrieve only necessary data fields, reducing the payload size and the number of API calls needed for data retrieval.</li>
                <li>Rate Limiting and Throttling: Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent exceeding Salesforce API limits, especially during peak usage periods or large data transfers.</li>
                <li>API Monitoring: Monitor API usage using Salesforce's API Usage Report and event monitoring tools to identify excessive or inefficient API calls.</li>
            </ul>

        <summary>99. How do you ensure efficient memory usage and avoid heap size limits in Salesforce Apex? [Scalability]</summary>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>SOQL for Loops: Use SOQL for loops instead of traditional for loops to ensure efficient memory management when processing large datasets. SOQL for loops process records in batches, avoiding heap size issues.</li>
                <li>Reduce Data in Memory: Only query and manipulate the minimum number of records and fields required for the business logic. Avoid holding unnecessary data in memory.</li>
                <li>Use Limits Class: Use the Limits.getHeapSize() method to track heap usage during execution and proactively prevent heap size errors by managing data accordingly.</li>
                <li>Streaming Data Processing: Use Streaming API or Queueable Apex to process large data volumes asynchronously rather than holding large data sets in memory during synchronous processing.</li>
                <li>Batch Apex: For operations requiring large datasets, use Batch Apex to process records in manageable chunks, reducing the risk of hitting heap size limits.</li>
            </ul>

        <summary>100. How do you manage and monitor Salesforce system performance at scale? [Scalability] [Security]</summary>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Event Monitoring: Use Salesforce Shield Event Monitoring to track system performance, including API usage, page load times, SOQL query execution times, and overall system health.</li>
                <li>Governor Limit Monitoring: Continuously monitor Salesforce governor limits such as SOQL limits, DML limits, and CPU time. Use debug logs and the Developer Console to track and optimize resource usage.</li>
                <li>Optimizer Report: Run Salesforce Optimizer regularly to identify performance issues and inefficiencies, such as unused fields, reports, workflows, and slow-loading pages.</li>
                <li>Lightning Usage App: Use the Lightning Usage App to track Lightning page performance, user behavior, and identify components or pages that are causing slow load times.</li>
                <li>Proactive Maintenance: Regularly review system logs, debug logs, and performance reports. Identify and address bottlenecks in custom code, integrations, or data models that could impact performance at scale.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
